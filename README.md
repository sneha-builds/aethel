## 🌀 Aethel: A Chronological Odyssey of the Web
**Aethel** is a high-fidelity, immersive digital museum built with Next.js 14 and GSAP. It reimagines the "scroll" not as a vertical movement but as a Z-axis ascension through the history of internet design. Users don't just browse content; they travel through the design DNA of the 90s, the Y2K era, and the Modern age.

## The Experience
Unlike traditional websites, Aethel utilizes a "Temporal Anchor" logic. As the user scrolls, the application interceptors the input to drive a 3D camera zoom.Z-Axis Immersion: Elements scale and fade from the distance ($z: -5000$) to the foreground ($z: 2000$), creating a "tunnel" effect.Fluid Morphing: Design tokens (border-radius, blur, shadows) are not static. They tween in real-time as you transition between eras.Era-Accurate Physics: From the rigid, tactile "clicked" buttons of 1995 to the frictionless, glowing glass of 2024.

## Technical Stack
**Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)

**Animation Engine**: GSAP (ScrollTrigger & Timeline)**

**UI Components**: Framer Motion (Internal element transitions)

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Custom "Era" design tokens)

**State Management**: Global CSS Variable Injection via ThemeEngine.tsx
